## About

Let's Pepper is a grass triples tournament series that strips volleyball down to its essentials: fewer players, faster decisions, more touches, more opportunities to make athletic plays.

**No coach. No bench. Just you, your crew, and the wind in your toss.**

## Design System

### Heat Levels
The brand uses pepper-themed heat levels for visual hierarchy:

- **Bell (Mild):** Green `#4ADE80` — Season Opener
- **Jalapeño (Hot):** Orange `#F97316` — Mid-Season Peak
- **Poblano (Medium):** Yellow `#FACC15` — Season Finale

### Typography
- **Display:** Bebas Neue (headings)
- **Body:** Inter (paragraphs)
- **Accent:** Space Mono (labels, badges)

## Media

- **Photography:** [Flickday Media](https://flickdaymedia.com)
- **Gallery:** [letspepper.com/gallery](https://letspepper.com/gallery)

## Deployment

The site is deployed on Cloudflare Pages at [letspepper.com](https://letspepper.com). Push to `main` triggers the GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds with `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` and deploys via `wrangler pages deploy`.

```bash
# Manual production deployment (rarely needed; CI handles it)
pnpm exec @cloudflare/next-on-pages
pnpm dlx wrangler pages deploy .vercel/output/static --project-name=letspepper
```

The build output directory is named `.vercel/output/static` because that's the Next.js standard output path that `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` consumes — not a sign of a Vercel deployment.
